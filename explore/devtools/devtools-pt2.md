1. Both `num1` and `num2` are `string` data types, and so the `+` operation ends up being string concatenation rather than numeric addition. Hence, result is also a `string` data type, specifically the concatenation of `num1` and `num2`.
2. In order to fix this bug, I need to make it so that the `+` operation is numeric addition, which only happens when there are no string operands. Or the operands are both numbers. Hence, I can declare and initialize `result` to be the sum of `num1` and `num2` that have both been converted into numbers: `Number(num1) + Number(num2)`.
